            "text": "<p mt-0>In the fall of 1851, William Henry, commonly known as “Jerry”, had been living in Syracuse for 8 years, working as a cooper. He had escaped enslavement in Missouri, but since the fall of the previous year he had been living under the shadow of the Fugitive Slave Act, which required all US citizens to support the capture of those who had escaped enslavement even in the northern states where slavery was illegal. Many in Syracuse were opposed to the law, and formed a Vigilance Committee.</p><p>On October 1, 1851, Jerry was arrested and taken to the US Commissioner's Office where he was charged as a fugitive slave. On that same day, there were many people in town for the state convention of an abolitionist political party called the Liberty Party. Church bells were rung and word of Jerry's arrest spread quickly through the Vigilance Committee. A large crowd, both black and white, gathered in and around the Townsend block where Jerry was being held. They endeavored to free Jerry and he was able to escape down the stairs while still in chains, and made it just past Hanover Square before he was recaptured and shackled. With a broken rib and severe bruising, he was dragged to the police station in the Journal Building, across the street between Water Street and the Erie Canal (now Erie Boulevard).</p><p>Reverend Samuel May of the Unitarian Church, Reverend Jermain Loguen of the AME Zion Church, and 25 other members of the Vigilance Committee met to form a plan. By the time of Jerry's hearing that evening, a crowd of over 2000 had formed in front of the building. The sheriff feared a riot, and called the National Guard, Syracuse's Citizens Corps, and the Washington Artillery. The National Guard refused to respond and the Citizens Corps disbanded, leaving the Washington Artillery on their own. Jerry's trial was postponed until morning, and the Artillery fired blank shots from a cannon to disperse the crowd. In an advantageous twist for the Vigilance Committee's planned rescue, the fleeing crowd made way for their approach. Armed with iron bars and axes from abolitionist Charles Wheaton's hardware store, as well as clubs and a battering ram made from a ten foot long pine beam, they broke down the door. Two marshals confronted the rescuers, but they were overpowered. An awaiting carriage drove Jerry to safety, where his shackles were removed and his wounds treated. He was hidden in Syracuse for four days, at the home of a man with a pro-slavery reputation, who sheltered him for humanitarian reasons. The authorities did not think to look for him there. He was transported north to Oswego County and eventually smuggled by ship across Lake Ontario to Canada. The members of the Vigilance Committee who planned the rescue were charged, but none were ever convicted. For many years, abolitionists gathered on the anniversary of the rescue to celebrate the significance of the day.</p>",
