            "text": "<p mt-0>The area surrounding Fayette Park was home to several abolitionists, and the park and houses around it witnessed some significant events.</p><p>On Sunday, July 30, 1843, the great American orator and abolitionist Frederick Douglass spoke near the north side of the park, in front of the home of Stephen & Rosa Smith, who had invited him to speak there after they found out that he hadn't been able to book a hall to speak in during his visit to Syracuse. His small audience grew to 500 by the afternoon. That evening the First Congregational Church offered Douglass and his audience a building to continue their activities for three more days. The speech on July 30 was one of many Douglass would give in Syracuse over the years, including another in Fayette Park in 1847.</p><p>Douglass had formerly been enslaved in Maryland, where he taught himself to read and write and then taught other enslaved Americans. He escaped slavery in 1838, and went on to become a prominent activist, starting an abolitionist newspaper in his new home of Rochester. He authored 5 books, the first of which was his famed autobiography, “Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave”. He became the first African-American to hold high office when he was appointed ambassador to Haiti in 1889, a position he held for two years. His advocacy for the rights of African-Americans and women have been an inspiration to subsequent generations of people working for equality. You can hear a portion of his famous speech “What to the Slave is 4th of July?” by clicking the button.</p><p>Charles & Ellen Wheaton also lived on the north side of the park. Charles was a successful businessman and built the Wheaton Block on South Salina & Water Streets. In 1838 the Wheatons were part of a group that left the First Presbyterian Church to found the First Congregational Church, because the former refused to take an official position against slavery. Their home was a stop on the Underground Railroad from 1839 - 1847. Charles took an active stand against the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act, which required all US citizens to support the capture of those who had escaped enslavement even in the northern states where slavery was illegal. He was also part of a group of citizens who rescued William “Jerry” Henry, who had escaped slavery and was captured in Syracuse and jailed in a building that stood at what is now Clinton Square, which is another stop on this tour. Charles' wife Ellen Birdseye Wheaton kept a diary from 1850 to her death in 1858, which was published in 1923. It details her family and social life as well as her reform activities, and includes comments on events in Syracuse's abolitionist movement and the women's rights movement.</p><p>Hamilton White and his wife Adelaide lived in the only home from that era that still stands today. It's the large red brick Greek Revival mansion on the east side of the park, next to the church. White was a merchant and philanthropist who gave to many causes, including African-American churches and the Underground Railroad. He took a public stand against the Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854, which expanded slavery in the west. His brother Horace is believed to have been directly involved in the Underground Railroad.</p>",
